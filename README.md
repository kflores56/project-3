## General Information
> The City of Austin recently conducted  a [study](https://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Housing/Austin%20HMA_final.pdf) with Root Policy Research which noted that Austin's median home value rose 55% from 2010. While Austin is considered affordable when compared with cities in California or the Pacific Northwest, a 55% increase in house price is notable. Our aim was to create a tool that would allow potential homebuyers to better understand the cost of a home in Austin depending on the size of home that best suits their needs. 


## Technologies Used
- Python Pandas 
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Seaborn
- Tableau
- Machine Learning 
- Scikit-Learn
- Joblib


## Data
> We found a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ericpierce/austinhousingprices) that contained 2021 housing data from Austin. The data inclued over 45 features which provided our team a solid foundation for data analysis around housing information in Austin. 
>
> For the initial analysis of our data, we create several plots for variables we were curious to learn more about which can be seen below:

![histogram_plots](./images/feature_histogram_plots.png)

> We also created some initial renderings of our property's location using latitude and longitude and the location correlated with the price.
